### i.Description

This is inspired by TraderVue, a trading journal geared torwards day traders that input stock,etf,bitcoins, & other instruments traded in th US financial markets as data entrys to provide insights from statistical metrics.

As there are many ways to provide statical measures on such data such as average, mean, median, standard deviation, I want to make a neural network from scratch that will train a model to predict how your performance can be forecasted.
